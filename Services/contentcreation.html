        <h1>Content Creation</h1>
        <p>Content creation is all about giving value to your customer. When value is received, it is returned. 
            Therefore, the higher the value of the content you produce, the higher the value you will receive from your customers in return.
            The good thing about everything going digital is that there is now a significantly better chance for small businesses to thrive. 
            However, this means that competition has increases that much more. Going up against all these other businesses in your niche can be very intimidating.
            As we've said, having a strong brand is your best bet to making a name on the industry, when beating competitors on price and quality can be very expensive. 
            Content is how your brand goes from just an idea, to an actual thing. </p>
